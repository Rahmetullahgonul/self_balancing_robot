# Self-Balancing Robot (MSP430)
This project involves the development of a self-balancing robot using the MSP430 microcontroller. The robot is designed to maintain its balance autonomously through real-time adjustments, using sensors and motors to counteract any tilting. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a feedback control system in robotics.


Features:

MSP430 Microcontroller: The core of the system, responsible for processing sensor data and controlling the motors.
MPU6050: An accelerometer and gyroscope used to measure the tilt and orientation of the robot.
L298N Motor Driver: Used to control the 6V DC motors that drive the robotâ€™s wheels.
Self-balancing Mechanism: The robot uses feedback control to continuously adjust its position and stay upright.

## 5.12V 3A Power Supply
Power Requirements:

Voltage: This circuit operates on a 8V to 12V power supply, which is suitable for both the motors and other components.
Current: The total current consumption of the circuit is approximately 1.5A when the motors are running under typical load conditions. A 12V 3A power supply should be sufficient to power the system.

#### 5.1 LM1117T 3.3v
Note: A voltage regulator is required to provide 3.3V power for the MSP430 and MPU6050 components.
